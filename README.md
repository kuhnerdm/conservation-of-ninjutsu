# Gameplay

The gameplay for this game is very simple. As an endless wave of enemies runs towards you, you must counter their attacks with attacks of your own. As the game progresses, you have less time to react, and you must complete more consecutive attacks to score points.

# Control Scheme

The goal of using two sets of two buttons to choose your attack was to keep in line with the Ludum Dare 34 theme "Two-Button Controls" while removing the issue of players quickly developing muscle memory. Having to reposition the entire hand over the arrow keys makes it harder to subconsciously decide what to do as soon as you see the color of the next indicator.

This game was created and submitted to Ludum Dare 34, with the theme "Two-Button Controls / Growing"
